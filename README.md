Friendcast
==========

Friendcast is an Android app that makes it easier to hang out with friends! You just click a button that says "Friendcast", choose a location you want your friends to meet you at, and it will send a push notification to your friends notifying them that you want to hang out! Your friends can then accept the invitation if they are also available, or deny the invitation if they are busy. The goal of the app is to make the process of hanging out with friends easier, more instantaneous, and more spontaneous.
